# Ideas

## Improvements

1. Better kawaii emoji / 8 bit ui, Y2K nostalgia vibe, retrowave
2. CLI command 'adorable -s offradio' search offradio and autoplay
3. CLI command 'adorable -f' autoplays the first favorite radio
4. Top 15 radios list. Press `down` at the last item and keep navigating.
5. Escape route when radios request fails.
6. Load more radios, pagination

## Bugs

1. Play pause not working great
2. Pressing q doesn't quit as long as audio is playing.
3. When the initial fetch request fails, the app is unusable.
4. Resizing the window breaks the UI (creates duplicate list, clips the window, ...)
